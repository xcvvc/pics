Working with Legacy iPhoto

These scripts allow me to reach out into my older iMac archive and pull a collection of small (thumb), medium and high resolution images from an iPhoto folder.  I can then burn a cd or dvd (or a drive) and send the photos off to the destination.

All of this flexibility is due to the [older] use of XML to contain the archive details at the location:<br>
lg -> Pictures -> iPhoto Library -> AlbumData.xml

instructions.txt

file instructions.txt is an overview for the sequence to run scripts. Practice with a small collection of 3-4 pictures in 2-3 iPhoto albums using a copy of the original scripts be accustomed to the changes to make in the scripts.

When hearing on the radio a while ago that iMacs would no longer install iPhoto, I became very happy that I had put the included perl scripting to use on my older equipment.

As was my circumstance, I have an archive of 8,000 photos, scanned from silver-halide negative and slide.
